# DAT355_Fourth_Assignment_DSL


Trafficlight DSL is useful to simulate the state of a trafficlight in a simple and easy to understand manner.<br>
As a small system of sequence changing states, it is a relatively simple domain to model.




Shopping DSL can be used to simulate the state of filling a cart when shopping online,<br>
and perform transactions to pay for the selected items.
(Not yet fully implemented. Just ignore it...)




Engineignition DSL is meant to simulate the car engine ignition process:<br>
Going from a stopped engine --> to running over a time period;<br>
from a running engine --> to a stopped engine over some period of time;<br>
and from a stopped engine --> to heating the engine before moving to running state after some time,<br>
if the engine temperature is below some threshold.<br>

Cars are complex machines, requiring millions of lines of code to operate.<br>
By abstracting small parts of the domain, like the engine ignition process,<br>
we can simplify the code a little and save some of the developers's sanity by reducing the overall complexity.
